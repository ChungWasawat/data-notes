+ Types of impact that data engineer can provide

  - Hard-to-measure (hard in term of difficulty and time worthy): Quality improvements (data quality or bugs fixing) and team enablement outcomes (saving time from script or any actions)
  - Immeasurable: Changing intuitions (changing how decision will be made), team culture improvements (creating team dynamic as a leader), being a glue person (holding the team together from being in their own silo)
